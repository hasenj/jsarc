Start small -- implement the smallest subset of lisp/arc one can get away with

datatypes: symbols, strings, numbers, functions
if
t, nil
fn

quote
quasiquote
    unquote
    unquote-splicing

for datatypes, maybe define them as such:

    class DataType:
        toString: how an instance is displayer
        value: the actual value stored in the type?
        type: the name of the datatype?

    or maybe not; I'm thinking of this only as a way to unify symbols (which don't exist in JS) with other types like strings and numbers (which DO existin JS)

    functions do exist in JS, but I don't know .. they're not "exactly" the same ..

    besdies quasiquoting, a big challenge will be implementing colsures ..
