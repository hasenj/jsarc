Start small -- implement the smallest subset of lisp/arc one can get away with

datatypes: symbols, strings, numbers, functions
if
t, nil
fn

quote
quasiquote
    unquote
    unquote-splicing

for datatypes, maybe define them as such:

    class DataType:
        toString: how an instance is displayer
        value: the actual value stored in the type?
        type: the name of the datatype?

    or maybe not; I'm thinking of this only as a way to unify symbols (which don't exist in JS) with other types like strings and numbers (which DO existin JS)

    functions do exist in JS, but I don't know .. they're not "exactly" the same ..

    besdies quasiquoting, a big challenge will be implementing colsures ..

----------------------------

in coffeescript, we implement a basic lisp

then we implement an Arc on top of it (as macros)

For instance, we implement lambda as:
    (lambda arguments statement statement ....)

And then implement the arc 'fn' as a macro on top of it

we implement a basic 'set' form, and implement the Arc '=' on top of it.

It's probably a good idea to use underscores in these "basic" forms' names so people don't use them, e.g. __lambda__
